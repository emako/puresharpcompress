# PureSharpCompress

Since [SharpCompress](https://github.com/adamhathcock/sharpcompress) version [0.34.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SharpCompress/0.34.0), it has started depending on [ZstdSharp.Port](https://github.com/oleg-st/ZstdSharp), which means it is no longer a pure C# implementation. As a result, the library removed the Zstd support to ensure that subsequent versions remain purely C#-based.

SharpCompress is a compression library in pure C# for .NET Framework 4.62, .NET Standard 2.1, .NET 6.0 and NET 8.0 that can unrar, un7zip, unzip, untar unbzip2, ungzip, unlzip with forward-only reading and file random access APIs. Write support for zip/tar/bzip2/gzip/lzip are implemented.

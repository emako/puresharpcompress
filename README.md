# PureSharpCompress

Since [SharpCompress](https://github.com/adamhathcock/sharpcompress) version [0.34.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SharpCompress/0.34.0), it has started depending on [ZstdSharp.Port](https://github.com/oleg-st/ZstdSharp), which means it is no longer a pure C# implementation. As a result, the library removed the Zstd support to ensure that subsequent versions remain purely C#-based.
